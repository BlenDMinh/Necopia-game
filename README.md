## Project Overview üßê

Necopia is a mobile game designed to raise awareness about environmental protection by engaging players in the care of virtual pets. The game aims to increase consciousness about the impact of climate change through educational narratives and warning scenes. Players will be educated on real-life scenarios and offered temporary solutions by their virtual cats.

## Project Description üåü

Necopia is a "virtual pet-raising" game where cats showcase the effects of climate change on their surroundings. The game incorporates real-time weather conditions (rain, clear skies, night, high dust levels, high UV index, etc.) influencing the virtual pet's interface. Information such as UV index, temperature, humidity, and dust levels is displayed.

### Main Features: üëå

1. **Pet Care Interface:** Adapts to external real-time weather conditions.
2. **Daily Pet Care Tasks:** Play with the pet and perform daily tasks (feeding, bathing, watching TV, etc.).
3. **Earn Money by Addressing Environmental Issues:** Answer daily environmental questions to earn in-game currency. Use the currency to purchase items from the shop and customize your space and cats.

## Key Points of Emphasis üîë

Necopia's unique feature lies in its ability to warn players about the impact of climate change, thereby enhancing their environmental awareness. As a game developer, influencing people's perception of environmental protection is a significant challenge. Necopia aims to revolutionize the entertainment industry with an accessible interface and user-friendly features while simultaneously raising awareness about the severe effects of climate change on the environment.
